## Phase 1: Implementing a Queue
The queue is FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order data structure. To implmenet the queue, we used two structs, one struct was used to refer each individual items of the queue, and another struct called queue to keep track of length, head, and the tail of the queue. queue_create() function initializes the queue by allocating dynamic memory. new element can be added to the queue by calling queue_enqueue() function. elements can be removed either by calling the dequeue function, which removes the oldest item in the queue, or by calling queue_delete() function and supplying it with the item to be deleted. When done with queue, we can call the destroy function which takes care of freeing all dynamic memory that was allocated.
we created a tester file (queue_tester.c) which included multiple test cases. The code passed all test cases.


## Phase 2: Implmenting Uthread API (ie User-level threads)
The thread control block (TCB)  struct helps us to keep of each thread. it has 3 elements; one to keep track of the state of the thread, another used as pointer to the stack of thread, and the last element used to store context of the thread. uthread_run() function checks whether preemption is set to true. if it’s, then it enables preemtion by calling preempt_start(true). then we created two queues (utilizing the functions from phase 1). one queue (ready_queue) used to keep track of all non-finished threads, and another queue (exited_queue) to keep track of all finished ones (ie zombie threads). Next we create a new thread and add it read_queue. Then thread that called uthread_run() function then becomes an idle thread, always yielding to other threads, unless if the are no more threads left in ready_queue then it we return and finish utilizing the uthread library. We also destroy take of destroying all finished threads in this function. Uthread_yeild function is responsible of initiating context switch, but before doing so, we disable preemption (ensuring that no other thread will take the processor from this thread), since context switching operation is considered a critical section. after disabling preemption, we add the current thread to the end of ready_queue, then pop the next thread and change it’s state to running, after that we do context switch by calling uthread_ctx_switch. when done with all these, we re-enable preemption. uthread_exit takes care of destroying the finished threads stacks, then adding those threads to exited_queue, then switching context to the next thread in ready_queue.

## Phase 3:  semaphore API



## Phase 4: Implementing preemption
Our preemption implementation triggers SIGVTALARM every 10 milli-second, the configuration of SIGVTALARM signal has been modified to call alarm_handerl function which in turn calls uthread_yield  so that any threads cannot take the CPU for too long. To start the alarm, we have to call preempt_start function with preempt parameter set to True. We can also disable and re-enable the alarm by calling preempt_disable, and preempt_enable respectively. Finally when we are done with the alarm, we call preempt_stop to restore configuration to it’s original state. The tester file for this phase starts by calling uthread_run, thereby enabling the user-thread library so that we can check that indeed our code does preemption every 10 milli-second. the idle creates another thread. that thread calls foo function. In foo function we create 2 threads, and then enter to infinite while loop. So if preemption implementation is not correct then we won’t be switching to  other threads and we will be stuck in while loop. However our code successfully switches to other threads and one of the threads raises SIGINT signal finishing the test.
