## Phase 1: Implementing a Queue
The queue is FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order data structure. To implmenet the queue, we used two structs, one to represent each individual items of the queue, and another struct to called queue to keep track of length, head, and tail of the queue. queue_create() function initializes the queue by allocating dynamic memory. new element can be added to the queue by calling queue_enqueue() function. elements can be removed either by calling the dequeue function, which removes the oldest item in the queue, or by calling queue_delete() function and supplying it with the item to be deleted. When done with queue, we can call the destroy function which takes care of freeing all dynamic memory that was allocated.
we created a tester file (queue_tester.c) which included multiple test cases. The code passed all test cases.
